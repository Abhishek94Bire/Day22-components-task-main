# React- Day -3 : props, state, rendering
Kindly check "App.js", "Child1.js", Child2.js" and "App.css" files to verify the code.    
The actual value is from "Child1.js".   
That value is fed back to the parent component (App.js).   
From the parent component (App.js) that value is sent to "Child2.js".   
Finally the value from "Child1.js" (via App.js) is shown in "Child2.js" component
